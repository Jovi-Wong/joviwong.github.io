## Work Experience

### [JIANGSU SHONCLOUD TECHNOLOGY CO.LIMITED](https://shoncloud.com/)
This is a leading CAE company in China providing industrial stimulation software to university and manufacturing enterprises. During the internship, I was designated to deploy the linear system solver onto multi-GPU architecture. In order to complete this task, I have read numerous articles on numerical algebra searching for an algorithm suitable for parallel computing in heterogenous devices. Besides, I have utilized CUDA and MPI to implement the algorithm aiming at exploiting the computing power of all devices totally.

## Technique Stack

### Artificial Intelligence
#### Computer Vision

* [Brain Tumour Detection](https://github.com/Jovi-Wong/Brain-Tumor-Detection)

    This project, tutored by professor Yike Guo who is the Director of the Data Science Insititute in Imperial College London, is constituted by two tasks, to diagnose the existence of brain tumor through a CT picture and then to locate areas  where tumors lay. Diagnosing brain tumors by CT pictures has been known as a dominant area of medical experts for a long time. Our team has utilized Tensorflow which is a framework of Python, to apply models, VGG and Unet++, and hits 84% accuracy rate in the first task and 75% accuracy rate in the second task on the given dataset, approaching experts' level. Finally, our presentation is highly recognized by the professor.

#### Graph Neural Network

* [Signed Network](https://gitee.com/jovi-wong/ETA)
    
    In this project, I proposed a new model called ETA(Encode then Augument) for learning the embeddings of nodes in social network.
    
    
### High Performance Computing
    
* [Finite Element Method for Solving PDE](https://gitee.com/jovi-wong/FEM2021)

    This is a open source project on Gitee website conducted by professor of the school of mathematical sciences, Heyu Wang, solving Poisson equation under Dirichlet boundary condition by finite element method. As I continued to contribute code written in C++ to the professor finite element method repository and then become the coauthor of the software. To optimize the program performance, I have applied OpenMP as well as utilize GPU to accelerate the computing process to obtain the best performance of the program.
